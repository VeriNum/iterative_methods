# Verified Error Analysis for Stationary Iterative Methods

This repository contains the Coq formalization described in the paper *[Towards Verified Rounding Error Analysis for
Stationary Iterative Methods](https://github.com/VeriNum/iterative_methods/blob/main/correctness_workshop_paper.pdf)*, which appeared at Correctness 2022: Sixth International Workshop on Software Correctness for HPC Applications.

The main theorem for iterative round-off error is found in the file global_float_error.v. In order to run the proof script, you will need to have installed the [Coq platform](https://github.com/coq/platform) and [VCFloat](https://github.com/VeriNum/vcfloat).
